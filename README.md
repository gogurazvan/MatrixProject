# MatrixProject
In this project I tried to make a snake game with menu. In the menu I have the following options: start game, highscores, settings, how to play and about.
The game starts when you select the start game option. In the settings option you can adjust the lcd and matrix brightness, the lcd contrast, the sound and the game difficulty.
